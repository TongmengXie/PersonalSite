    "text": "2.2 Key Findings:\n\n2.2.1 Air Quality Improvement:\nThe expansion of ULEZ on October 25, 2021, led to a noticeable but not significant improvement in air quality. Specifically, there was a 3-9% reduction in PM10-associated pollutants in Greater London.\n\n\n2.2.2 Sub-Questions:\n\nCategorization of Pollutants: Pollutants were organized into groups based on their collinearity. The categories include:\n\nNOx (NO, NO2, NOXasNO2)\nPM10 & Associated (PM10, NV10, V10)\nPM2.5_Associated (NV2.5, V2.5, AT2.5, AP2.5)\nSO2 (SO2, AP10, CO)\nUncategorised: PM2.5, O3\n\nCausality: The study confirmed a causal relationship between ULEZ expansion and air quality improvement through Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD).\nSpatial Patterns: Air quality improved not just within the expanded ULEZ area but also in areas outside it, potentially due to spatial spillover effects.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Areas for Further Research:\n\nOther Pollutants: Further investigation is needed to understand the impact on other pollutants.\nAverage Performance Metrics: A more comprehensive measure of air quality improvement is yet to be developed.\nTime Scope: The timeframe for assessing the effects of ULEZ expansion may need adjustment and could necessitate iterative analysis."

    "text": "3.2 Key Findings:\n\n3.2.1 Relationship between Attainment 8 and Deprivation\n\nAfter accounting for deprivation-related variables, the model’s explanatory power (Adj. R2) increased from 57.5% to 77.3%.\nAn additional 1% of students with Special Education Needs (SEN) is associated with a 48.3-point decrease in a borough’s attainment 8 score.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Hypothesis Tests\n\nSeverity of Socio-Economic Disadvantages in Liverpool & Manchester: There is no significant difference in the level of deprivation in and outside of Liverpool & Manchester.\nImpact of Socio-Economic Disadvantages in Liverpool & Manchester: Socio-demographic disadvantages are more heavily weighted in Liverpool & Manchester, affecting educational outcomes more than they do in the rest of England.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Model Limitations\n\nOne variable related to socio-demographics in Liverpool & Manchester had a p-value greater than 0.05, indicating the model may not be a perfect fit.\nThe study may benefit from the inclusion of other socio-economic factors like disability, or the use of machine learning techniques for better fit."

    "text": "3.3 Discussion\nStudents in Liverpool & Manchester are more socio-demographically disadvantaged, and this has a heavier impact on their educational outcomes than for students outside these areas. Interventions such as cultural competency training for educators and safe spaces for marginalized students could improve educational equity and inclusion in Liverpool & Manchester.\nBy understanding these factors, policymakers can better tailor interventions to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds."

    "text": "Especially, the workflow of Google Earth Engine gives me a template of handling big-data and designing online EO data workflow, including the fast deployment of machine learning models in EO image classification tasks introduced in Week 6 and Week 7.\nAlso, the exemplar ways of approaching policy gaps between plans and execution by introducing EO data and remote sensing will guide me to utilise technical expertise to participate in policy framing and improvement. The group presentation also gave me a chance to do so in designing a flood risk management solution in Kuala Lumpur. The outcome can be viewed here, thanks to all team members’ collaborated efforts.\nThanks to Andy, who delivered this amazing module!"
