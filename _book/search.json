    "text": "1.2 Application:\n“Spectral Feature Space, Vegetation On Bands B04 and B08”\nOne of the applications really attracted me was the spatial signature of vegetation on the terra, as we could assign features to each end of the spatial signature area see Figure 1.1, such as bare land on the right end of the triangle-like area where red light captured are dense while near-infrared level is low. Heavy vegetation are witnessed at the upper end of the triangle-like area where red light low and near-infrared is high, indicating heavy biomass. As for the left-down corner where both red and near-infrared are low, we can identify wet lands. This is integrated in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to estimate vegetation cover.\nSpatial signatures can also be used to monitor the health of vegetation by identifying patterns of quavariation in spectral reflectance that are indicative of stress or disease. For example, vegetation that is stressed or diseased may have a different spectral reflectance signature than healthy vegetation, which can be identified using spatial signatures.\nIn addition, spatial signatures can be used to monitor the growth and distribution of vegetation over time by comparing satellite imagery from different dates. This can be useful for understanding the impacts of land use changes, climate change, and other factors on vegetation.\nOverall, spatial signatures are a powerful tool for vegetation monitoring, as they can be used to identify and classify different types of vegetation, monitor vegetation health, and track vegetation changes over time."

For example, Landsat dataset are captured by this sort\nAlong track scanners: Basically several detectors pushed along. E.g., Quickbird, SPOT\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric Correction\nRS data could include image distortions introduced by: View angle, topography, wind and rotation of the earth\nWe identify Ground Control Points (GCP) in distorted data to match them with local map, correct image, or GPS data from handheld device, but these reference images could also contain distortions and imprecisions.\nRMSE is adopted here to measure fitness between images. Use GCPs to minimise RMSE.\nDoing geometric correction can shift the original image, so we want to re-sample the final raster by using Nearest Neighbour, Linear, Cubic, Cubic spline re-samplers\n\n\n3.1.3 Atmosphric Correction\nAccording to Jensen (1986), two factors contribute to environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering, topographic attenuation.\nThere are unnecessary and necessary atmospheric corrections:\nnecessary ones are:\n\nBiophysical parameters needed (e.g. temperature, leaf area index, NDVI)\nE.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and Livestock Early Warning System\nUsing spectral signatures through time and space\n\nAbsorption and scattering can create the haze, i.e. reduces contrast of image.\nScattering can create the “adjacency effect”, radiance from pixels nearby mixed into pixel of interest.\n\n\n3.1.4 Orthorectification Correction\nThis is a subset of georectification, i.e. giving coords to an image. Particularly Orthorectification means removing distortion so pixels can appear being viewed at nadir (straight down). This requires the support of an Elevation Model to calculate the nadir view for each pixel on a sensor geometry.\nTo do this: cosine correction, Minnaert correction, Statistical Empirical correction, C Correction (advancing the Cosine). Need radiance (DN to TOA) from sloped terrain, Sun’s zenith angle, Sun’s incidence angle - cosine of the angle between the solar zenith and the normal line of the slope. Latter two found in angle coefficient files (e.g. Landsat data ANG.txt).\n\n\n3.1.5 Rdiometric Correction\nCorrections to raw satellite imagery can be performed using a method called Dark Object Subtraction (DOS). The logic is that the darkest pixel in the image should be 0 and any value it has is due to the atmosphere. To remove the atmospheric effect, the value from the darkest pixel is subtracted from the rest of the pixels in the image. The calculation involves converting the Digital Number (DN) to radiance, computing the haze value for each band (but not beyond NIR), and subtracting the 1% reflectance value from the radiance. The calculation requires values such as mean exoatmospheric irradiance, solar azimuth, Earth-sun distance, and others, which can be found in sources such as Landsat user manuals.\n\n\n3.1.6 Joining data sets\nAlso known as Mosaicking: We feather two images, creating a seamless mosaic, where the diving lien is called seamline.\n\n\n3.1.7 Image Enhancements\nImage stretch, Band ratioing, Normalised Burn Ratio, Edge enhancement, Filtering, PCA, Image fusion (see application) etc."

The integration methods vary as the levels vary (Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli 2018).\nSatellite remote sensing (SRS) can be derived from Multispectral sensors and radar sensors. \n Multispectral sensors are passive, merely receiving electromagnetic waves reflected from surface, usually used to reflect chemical properties (such as nitrogen or carbon content and moisture). Usually produces data with comparatively low spatial resolution\n Radar ones emit electromagnetic radiation and measure the returning signal, responding to the three-dimensional structure of objects, being sensitive to their orientation, volume and surface roughness. Usually produces data with comparatively high spatial resolution\n\n3.2.1 Image fusion:\n1. decision-level (SRS integration), where separate predictors are used to estimate a parameter of interest. \n2. object-level (feature-level). unit: multi-pixel objects.

The parameter of interest can be a categorical variable, like land cover, or a continuous variable, like species richness. In pixel-level fusion, the original pixel values of radar and multispectral imagery are combined to yield new, derived pixel values. Object-based fusion refers to (1) using radar and multispectral imagery is input into an object-based image segmentation algorithm, or (2) segmenting each type of imagery separately before combining them. Finally, decision-level fusion corresponds to the process of quantitatively combining multispectral and radar imagery to derive the parameter of interest (by e.g. combining them in a regression model, or classification algorithm)\n\n\n3.2.2 Implementation Approaches\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Credit: Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli (2018)\n\n\npixel-level\n\nComponent substitution techniques: such as principal component analysis (PCA), Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS). \n\nPCA is the only pixel-level image fusion technique that cannot be applied to imagery with different spatial resolutions, and the only that allows unlimited image numbers.\n\nIHS fusion. Three images with lower spatial resolution (typically multispectral data) are integrated with a single image with high spatial resolution (typically radar) to retain the radiometry but increase the spatial resolution of the former.

It is thus important to explore how best to capitalise on recent technological developments and changes in SRS data availability. It is exctiing to apply solid machine learning methods to this area and it is marvelous to see the progress reflected by the increasing number of software supporting this application. The improvement of image quality enables new research designs in ecology and conservation areas and reignite previously greyed-out options.\nThe application of data correction, data fusion, and image enhancement techniques to SRS data can greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of SRS-derived parameters, which can then be used in various fields, including terrain detection, urban analysis, ecology, and conservation. With the rapid advancements in technology and the increasing availability of SRS data, there is a growing opportunity to leverage the latest machine learning techniques in this area. The development of new software tools to support these applications is a testament to the progress being made in this field. By enhancing the quality of the SRS data, researchers are able to design more robust and informative studies, unlocking new insights and avenues for exploration in ecology and conservation.

Traditional GIS software is eclipsed when it comes to both efficiency and scale.\nGEE’s unique and efficient way of conducting analysis flows is interesting, such as the introduction of concepts like client vs server-side operations and data reduction techniques. These was required by GEE’s feature of carrying out analyses on massive datasets (Gorelick et al. 2017). For those interested in BigData technology, the strategies (server/client split, no looping on server, etc.) applied by Google here is a very resourceful one and worth learning. The user end also has to learn to adopt good practices for reducing data range, which has been simplified to a series of reduction and filtering functions, e.g. ImageCollection.filterDate(), image.reduceNeighborhood()(Google 2023b).\nGEE’s combination with machine learning is also promising in regard of automating complex analysis tasks, as Machine Learning APIs offered by GEE support Supervised and Unsupervised Classification, and Regression (Google 2023a).

Endmembers refer to pure or nearly pure materials that are present within a mixed pixel. By modelling the spectral signature of a mixed pixel as a linear combination of the spectral signatures of the constituent endmembers, we can determine the contribution of each endmember to the overall reflectance or radiance of the mixed pixel.\nThis approach can be very useful in urban recognition, where it is essential to accurately classify the different land covers present within a pixel. Furthermore, it can also help us to understand the composition of the land cover in a given area, which can have important implications for environmental monitoring and management. This approach has been applied in various studies to estimate urban land cover, such as the work by Zhang et al. (2018) that utilised endmember extraction to detect urban impervious surfaces."

Alternatively, Surface Reflectance Classification can be treated as a downstream task for both aforementioned ML tasks, due to its uniqueness in dealing with high-precision satellite data and unseparability (worth debating) from EO processing workflow (calibration etc.). Also, uncertainty of classification genres derived from unsupervised labelling can also be an issue.\nOptionally, in supplementation to manual labelling, automated labelling workflow (e.g. roboflow) can be introduced to curtail repeatitive works in image labelling(Nair, Paul, and Jacob 2018). However, manual labelling is not replaceable at current time (Robison 2018) and the pinning down of ground truth seems to always need human intervention in addition to machine automation.\nThe introduction of production accuracy and user accuracy is also interesting, as these terminologies are designed presupposing a customer/producer split, dwarfing precision-recall in readability. The treadeoff to be made between the two is crucial, and this is problematically handled by introducing F1 score with two competitive components, and improved by introducing Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROCC) with two “good” indicators, true positive rate and false positive rate."

    "text": "8.2 Application\nMacLachlan et al. (2021) The document outlines a sub-city urban planning modeling approach using open-source tools to measure and monitor localised urban heat island (UHI) mitigation targets. The methodology involves comparing temperature dynamics of low- and high-density census areas using Earth observation data and determining optimal placement of greening elements in proposed plans using a data-driven model. The document concludes that this approach can be universally integrated into urban planning regulation frameworks to mitigate the localized UHI effect and ensure long-term city sustainability. Also it discusses the impact of low population density on housing in Perth, Australia, and the resulting need for strategic land zonation and sustainability targets. #### Why Data-driven approach\n\n8.2.1 Policy limitations\n\nlacking specificities for combating adverse temperature effects at the local level (sub-city), therefore not planning practicality\nno consistency in planning implementation methodologies or steps for assessing progress toward UHI reduction targets\nlackage of empirical evidence for optimizing UHI mitigation strategies\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Data to drive the new approach\n\nEarth Observation (EO) data can be processed to identify (un)sustainable urban development through aerial assessments of land cover change\ntemperature\nelevation\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Advantages for the Data-driven approach\n\nEO data can produce consistent information necessary for restricting unsustainable development\nmonitor UHI effects based on associated land-temperature dynamics\nAssessment at finer spatial scales (e.g., block subdivisions)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week addresses problems in\n\nThe object of using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n\nDetecting changes in the Earth’s surface over time\n\nThe advantages of SAR for change detection\n\nsee through clouds\nhigh temporal resolution\n\nTechniques for change detection with SAR?\n\nratio\nlog ratios between two images\nt-tests\n\nfused with other data?\n\nYes, with optical data using techniques such as\n\nprincipal component analysis\nobject-based image analysis\nintensity fusion\n\n\nApplications?\n\nmonitoring land use changes\ndetecting deforestation\nidentifying urban growth pattern\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution and accuracy:\n\nUrban planning: Improved resolution and accuracy can influence local zoning regulations and urban growth management by providing detailed information on land use changes and the built environment. For example, high-resolution SAR data can be used to assess the effectiveness of urban containment policies or to identify areas where infrastructure investments are needed.\n\nData processing capabilities\n\nDisaster response: The ability to process larger datasets and monitor Earth’s surface in near real-time can inform global policies and agreements related to disaster management, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Rapid response to natural disasters, like earthquakes or hurricanes, can be coordinated more effectively with updated SAR data, allowing for quicker deployment of resources and better management of affected areas.\n\nNew SAR applications\n\nAgricultural: Advancements in SAR technology will expand its use in change detection and monitoring. This will support policies like the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), by providing data on crop health, irrigation needs, and land use changes.\nForestry (deforestation and reforestation tracking)\nDisaster response (flood and landslide monitoring)\nEnvironmental management: SAR data can inform policies related to wetland and coastal zone management, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By monitoring changes in these sensitive areas, policymakers can evaluate the effectiveness of existing regulations and develop new strategies to protect vital ecosystems.\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence:\n\nAdvanced algorithms will be able to identify and classify features and changes in SAR data analysis in the Earth’s surface, improving the overall accuracy of change detection, thus supporting climate change adaptation efforts at both local and global levels, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Predictive models based on SAR data can help policymakers identify areas at risk of flooding, coastal erosion, or other climate-related impacts, enabling the development of targeted adaptation strategies.\n\n\nIn conclusion, advancements in SAR technology, combined with the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, will significantly enhance the capabilities for change detection and Earth surface monitoring. These developments will have far-reaching implications for various sectors, including agriculture, forestry, disaster management, and environmental protection, ultimately influencing policymaking and promoting more informed decision-making processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a type of radar that uses microwave signals to create high-resolution images of the Earth’s surface.\n\n\nAdvantages\nOperates in all weather conditions; penetrates through clouds and vegetation cover.\n\n\nLimitations\nSensitive to surface roughness; limited spatial resolution.\n\n\nProcessing Techniques\nInterferometry: combines multiple SAR images to create 3D maps of the Earth’s surface. Polarimetry: analyzes the polarization properties of reflected signals to extract additional information about surface features.\n\n\nApplications\nEnvironmental monitoring, disaster response, urban planning, military surveillance, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of SAR for Change Detection\nCan see through clouds unlike optical sensors; high temporal resolution.\n\n\nChange Detection Techniques\nRatio or log ratios between two images; t-tests; standard deviation.\n\n\nFusion of SAR and Optical Data\nPrincipal component analysis; object-based image analysis; intensity fusion.\n\n\nApplications of Change Detection with SAR\nMonitoring land use changes, detecting deforestation, identifying urban growth patterns, and more."
