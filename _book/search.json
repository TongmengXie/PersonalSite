    "text": "1.2 Application:\n“Spectral Feature Space, Vegetation On Bands B04 and B08”\nOne of the applications really attracted me was the spatial signature of vegetation on the terra, as we could assign features to each end of the spatial signature area see Figure 1.1, such as bare land on the right end of the triangle-like area where red light captured are dense while near-infrared level is low. Heavy vegetation are witnessed at the upper end of the triangle-like area where red light low and near-infrared is high, indicating heavy biomass. As for the left-down corner where both red and near-infrared are low, we can identify wet lands. This is integrated in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to estimate vegetation cover.\nSpatial signatures can also be used to monitor the health of vegetation by identifying patterns of quavariation in spectral reflectance that are indicative of stress or disease. For example, vegetation that is stressed or diseased may have a different spectral reflectance signature than healthy vegetation, which can be identified using spatial signatures.\nIn addition, spatial signatures can be used to monitor the growth and distribution of vegetation over time by comparing satellite imagery from different dates. This can be useful for understanding the impacts of land use changes, climate change, and other factors on vegetation.\nOverall, spatial signatures are a powerful tool for vegetation monitoring, as they can be used to identify and classify different types of vegetation, monitor vegetation health, and track vegetation changes over time."

    "text": "3.1 Summary:\n\n3.1.1 Different Sensors\nAcross track scanners: Mirror reflects light onto 1 detector. For example, Landsat dataset are captured by this sort\nAlong track scanners: Basically several detectors pushed along. E.g., Quickbird, SPOT\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric Correction\nRS data could include image distortions introduced by: View angle, topography, wind and rotation of the earth\nWe identify Ground Control Points (GCP) in distorted data to match them with local map, correct image, or GPS data from handheld device, but these reference images could also contain distortions and imprecisions.\nRMSE is adopted here to measure fitness between images. Use GCPs to minimise RMSE.\nDoing geometric correction can shift the original image, so we want to re-sample the final raster by using Nearest Neighbour, Linear, Cubic, Cubic spline re-samplers\n\n\n3.1.3 Atmosphric Correction\nAccording to Jensen (1986), two factors contribute to environmental attenuation: Atmospheric scattering, topographic attenuation.\nThere are unnecessary and necessary atmospheric corrections:\nnecessary ones are:\n\nBiophysical parameters needed (e.g. temperature, leaf area index, NDVI)\nE.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and Livestock Early Warning System\nUsing spectral signatures through time and space\n\nAbsorption and scattering can create the haze, i.e. reduces contrast of image.\nScattering can create the “adjacency effect”, radiance from pixels nearby mixed into pixel of interest.\n\n\n3.1.4 Orthorectification Correction\nThis is a subset of georectification, i.e. giving coords to an image. Particularly Orthorectification means removing distortion so pixels can appear being viewed at nadir (straight down). This requires the support of an Elevation Model to calculate the nadir view for each pixel on a sensor geometry.\nTo do this: cosine correction, Minnaert correction, Statistical Empirical correction, C Correction (advancing the Cosine). Need radiance (DN to TOA) from sloped terrain, Sun’s zenith angle, Sun’s incidence angle - cosine of the angle between the solar zenith and the normal line of the slope. Latter two found in angle coefficient files (e.g. Landsat data ANG.txt).\n\n\n3.1.5 Rdiometric Correction\nCorrections to raw satellite imagery can be performed using a method called Dark Object Subtraction (DOS). The logic is that the darkest pixel in the image should be 0 and any value it has is due to the atmosphere. To remove the atmospheric effect, the value from the darkest pixel is subtracted from the rest of the pixels in the image. The calculation involves converting the Digital Number (DN) to radiance, computing the haze value for each band (but not beyond NIR), and subtracting the 1% reflectance value from the radiance. The calculation requires values such as mean exoatmospheric irradiance, solar azimuth, Earth-sun distance, and others, which can be found in sources such as Landsat user manuals.\n\n\n3.1.6 Joining data sets\nAlso known as Mosaicking: We feather two images, creating a seamless mosaic, where the diving lien is called seamline.\n\n\n3.1.7 Image Enhancements\nImage stretch, Band ratioing, Normalised Burn Ratio, Edge enhancement, Filtering, PCA, Image fusion (see application) etc."

The integration methods vary as the levels vary (Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli 2018).\nSatellite remote sensing (SRS) can be derived from Multispectral sensors and radar sensors. \n Multispectral sensors are passive, merely receiving electromagnetic waves reflected from surface, usually used to reflect chemical properties (such as nitrogen or carbon content and moisture). Usually produces data with comparatively low spatial resolution\n Radar ones emit electromagnetic radiation and measure the returning signal, responding to the three-dimensional structure of objects, being sensitive to their orientation, volume and surface roughness. Usually produces data with comparatively high spatial resolution\n\n3.2.1 Image fusion:\n1. decision-level (SRS integration), where separate predictors are used to estimate a parameter of interest. \n2. object-level (feature-level). unit: multi-pixel objects. (1) using radar and multispectral imagery is input into an object-based image segmentation algorithm, or (2) segmenting each type of imagery separately before combining them. multi-pixel objects\n3. pixel-level (Observation-level), where pixel values are combined to derive a fused image with new pixel values, either in the spatial or the temporal domain.\n(2. and 3. derive entirely new predictors.)\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Credit: Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli (2018)\n\n\nSchematic overview of multispectral-radar SRS data fusion techniques. The parameter of interest can be a categorical variable, like land cover, or a continuous variable, like species richness. In pixel-level fusion, the original pixel values of radar and multispectral imagery are combined to yield new, derived pixel values. Object-based fusion refers to (1) using radar and multispectral imagery is input into an object-based image segmentation algorithm, or (2) segmenting each type of imagery separately before combining them. Finally, decision-level fusion corresponds to the process of quantitatively combining multispectral and radar imagery to derive the parameter of interest (by e.g. combining them in a regression model, or classification algorithm)\n\n\n3.2.2 Implementation Approaches\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Credit: Schulte to Bühne and Pettorelli (2018)\n\n\npixel-level\n\nComponent substitution techniques: such as principal component analysis (PCA), Intensity-hue-saturation (IHS). \n\nPCA is the only pixel-level image fusion technique that cannot be applied to imagery with different spatial resolutions, and the only that allows unlimited image numbers.\n\nIHS fusion. Three images with lower spatial resolution (typically multispectral data) are integrated with a single image with high spatial resolution (typically radar) to retain the radiometry but increase the spatial resolution of the former.

It is thus important to explore how best to capitalise on recent technological developments and changes in SRS data availability. It is exctiing to apply solid machine learning methods to this area and it is marvelous to see the progress reflected by the increasing number of software supporting this application. The improvement of image quality enables new research designs in ecology and conservation areas and reignite previously greyed-out options.\nThe application of data correction, data fusion, and image enhancement techniques to SRS data can greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of SRS-derived parameters, which can then be used in various fields, including terrain detection, urban analysis, ecology, and conservation. With the rapid advancements in technology and the increasing availability of SRS data, there is a growing opportunity to leverage the latest machine learning techniques in this area. The development of new software tools to support these applications is a testament to the progress being made in this field. By enhancing the quality of the SRS data, researchers are able to design more robust and informative studies, unlocking new insights and avenues for exploration in ecology and conservation. This, in turn, has the potential to lead to breakthroughs and innovations in these fields, making a significant impact on the world around us.\n\n\n\n\nJensen, J.

One of the key applications of these initiatives is to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers, particularly those in underrepresented communities. For example, the initiatives aimed at increasing the number of New Yorkers earning a high school equivalency diploma and connecting underrepresented groups to construction jobs created by City investments are designed to provide greater economic opportunities and upward mobility.\nSimilarly, the initiatives aimed at enhancing walkability and accessibility and improving the sustainability and efficiency of air travel are designed to improve the physical infrastructure of the city and make it more accessible and sustainable for all residents. Another application of these initiatives is to promote equity and inclusivity in the city.\nMany of the initiatives are specifically targeted at underrepresented communities, such as the initiatives aimed at providing paid internships and professional development opportunities to cultural workers and supporting the growth and retention of small businesses.\nBy providing resources and support to these communities, the city aims to promote greater equity and inclusivity and reduce disparities in access to resources and opportunities.\nThe initiatives also reflect a commitment to sustainability and resilience. Many of the initiatives are aimed at improving the city’s infrastructure and transportation systems to make them more sustainable and resilient in the face of climate change and other challenges. For example, the initiatives aimed at investing in innovative and resilient transportation networks and enhancing walkability and accessibility are designed to reduce emissions and congestion and promote sustainable modes of transportation.\nOverall, the initiatives outlined in the text reflect a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to improving life in New York City. While there is still much work to be done, these initiatives represent an important step forward in promoting equity, sustainability, and resilience in the city.

Traditional GIS software is eclipsed when it comes to both efficiency and scale.\nGEE’s unique and efficient way of conducting analysis flows is interesting, such as the introduction of concepts like client vs server-side operations and data reduction techniques. These was required by GEE’s feature of carrying out analyses on massive datasets (Gorelick et al. 2017). For those interested in BigData technology, the strategies (server/client split, no looping on server, etc.) applied by Google here is a very resourceful one and worth learning. The user end also has to learn to adopt good practices for reducing data range, which has been simplified to a series of reduction and filtering functions, e.g. ImageCollection.filterDate(), image.reduceNeighborhood()(Google 2023b).\nGEE’s combination with machine learning is also promising in regard of automating complex analysis tasks, as Machine Learning APIs offered by GEE support Supervised and Unsupervised Classification, and Regression (Google 2023a).

For example, the European Union’s Copernicus Programme could use this in providing free data from various satellite missions and sensors for environmental monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning.\n\nMulti-temporal analysis:\n\nSophisticated multi-temporal analysis techniques will be increasingly used to monitor changes in land cover, vegetation, and other features over time. This enables accurate and efficient change detection and monitoring of phenomena like urbanization, deforestation, and climate change. This aligns with the REDD+ initiative under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which uses multi-temporal analysis to monitor forest cover changes and evaluate policy effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.\n\nCloud-based processing:\n\nThe growth of cloud-based platforms, such as Google Earth Engine, allows for more efficient and scalable EO data processing workflows. This accessibility enables researchers and organizations to innovate in classification techniques and applications. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Big Data Project aims to make vast amounts of environmental data accessible and usable in the cloud, fostering innovation in developing new applications and services.\n\n\nThese advancements will provide comprehensive and timely information about Earth’s surface, informing policies and strategies in areas such as environmental management, disaster response, and urban planning."

    "text": "7.2 Application - to be completed\nIn remote sensing, it is often challenging to accurately classify mixed pixels, which contain a combination of different materials or components. Endmembers refer to pure or nearly pure materials that are present within a mixed pixel. By modelling the spectral signature of a mixed pixel as a linear combination of the spectral signatures of the constituent endmembers, we can determine the contribution of each endmember to the overall reflectance or radiance of the mixed pixel.\nThis approach can be very useful in urban recognition, where it is essential to accurately classify the different land covers present within a pixel. Furthermore, it can also help us to understand the composition of the land cover in a given area, which can have important implications for environmental monitoring and management. This approach has been applied in various studies to estimate urban land cover, such as the work by Zhang et al. (2018) that utilised endmember extraction to detect urban impervious surfaces."

    "text": "7.3 Reflection\nThe workflow of Classification of Surface Reflectance and Top of Atmosphere data intrigues me, as it differs from, yet shares certain features with traditional computer vision tasks like image classification and object detection (in regards of treating pixels as objects/units). Alternatively, Surface Reflectance Classification can be treated as a downstream task for both aforementioned ML tasks, due to its uniqueness in dealing with high-precision satellite data and unseparability (worth debating) from EO processing workflow (calibration etc.). Also, uncertainty of classification genres derived from unsupervised labelling can also be an issue.\nOptionally, in supplementation to manual labelling, automated labelling workflow (e.g. roboflow) can be introduced to curtail repeatitive works in image labelling(Nair, Paul, and Jacob 2018). However, manual labelling is not replaceable at current time (Robison 2018) and the pinning down of ground truth seems to always need human intervention in addition to machine automation.\nThe introduction of production accuracy and user accuracy is also interesting, as these terminologies are designed presupposing a customer/producer split, dwarfing precision-recall in readability. The treadeoff to be made between the two is crucial, and this is problematically handled by introducing F1 score with two competitive components, and improved by introducing Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROCC) with two “good” indicators, true positive rate and false positive rate."

For example, high-resolution SAR data can be used to assess the effectiveness of urban containment policies or to identify areas where infrastructure investments are needed.\n\nData processing capabilities\n\nDisaster response: The ability to process larger datasets and monitor Earth’s surface in near real-time can inform global policies regarding disaster management, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Boosted rapidness and data capability of SAR can better response to natural disasters, like earthquakes or hurricanes. This allows for quicker design of resources deployment strategy, and more comprehensive information in managing affected areas.\n\nNew SAR applications\n\nAgricultural: Enhanced SAR facilitates its use in change detection and monitoring. This will support policies like the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), by providing data on crop health, irrigation needs, and land use changes.\nForestry (deforestation and reforestation tracking)\nDisaster response (flood and landslide monitoring)\nEnvironmental management: SAR data can inform policies related to wetland and coastal zone management, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By monitoring changes in these sensitive areas, policymakers can evaluate the effectiveness of existing regulations and develop new strategies to protect vital ecosystems.\n\nMore matured machine learning and artificial intelligence:\n\nAdvanced algorithms that are yet to be developed or need further maturity for SAR data analysis could include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nImproved Unsupervised Change Detection Algorithms\n- No need for labeled training data. - Can discover unknown or unexpected changes.\n- May struggle with complex or subtle changes. - Can be sensitive to noise and variations in the data.\n\n\nMulti-Modal Fusion Algorithms\n- Combines SAR data with other sources (e.g., optical, hyperspectral) for better feature identification. - Can exploit the complementary strengths of different data types.\n- Requires data synchronization and registration, which can be challenging. - May involve increased complexity and computational cost.\n\n\nGraph-based Change Detection Algorithms\n- Can model complex spatial relationships between features. - Robust against noise and speckle effects in SAR data.\n- Computationally expensive, especially for large-scale datasets. - May require tuning of hyperparameters.\n\n\n\n\nImproved overall accuracy of change detection can support climate change adaptation efforts at both local and global levels, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Predictive models based on SAR data can help policymakers identify areas at risk of flooding, coastal erosion, or other climate-related impacts, enabling the targeted adaptation strategies.\n\n\nAdvancements in SAR technology, combined with the integration of machine learning and AI, will enhance change detection capabilities, enabling new analysis avenues in sectors including agriculture, forestry, disaster management, and environmental protection, ultimately influencing policymaking and promoting more informed decision-making processes."
